Leveraging design patterns for extensibility, it supports various instruments and stochastic processes. Core classes handle simulations, valuations, and statistics, while auxiliary classes manage tasks like covariance matrix calculation and historical backtesting.",

Using a checkerboard with 9 columns and 6 rows (54 internal corners) as the target, the system detects and extracts corners for camera calibration. Multiple images from different angles are used to determine intrinsic camera parameters such as focal length and image center. With the camera matrix and distortion coefficients, the project calculates the transitional and rotational vectors to accurately overlay 3D objects onto the 2D scene.',

      'For my masterâ€™s project, I am collaborating with CERN to enhance event reconstruction for the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. I am using PyTorch to develop and refine self-supervised machine learning models, specifically contrastive learning algorithms, to process data from the upgraded calorimeter with 6 million channels. By leveraging PyTorchâ€™s deep learning capabilities, I focus on training and optimizing these models to improve clustering and interpretation of particle collision events, aiming for more accurate and robust event reconstruction compared to traditional methods.',

I implemented two optimization methods: a Univariate minimizer and a Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimisation - Simulated Annealing (HPSO-SA) minimizer. The project focused on minimizing a negative log-likelihood function to extract the relevant parameters. I compared and tested both optimization approaches to ensure accuracy and efficiency, showcasing the power of machine learning in scientific analysis.',
