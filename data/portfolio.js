Using a checkerboard with 9 columns and 6 rows (54 internal corners) as the target, the system detects and extracts corners for camera calibration. Multiple images from different angles are used to determine intrinsic camera parameters such as focal length and image center. With the camera matrix and distortion coefficients, the project calculates the transitional and rotational vectors to accurately overlay 3D objects onto the 2D scene.',

      'In this project, I developed a Python application to estimate neutrino oscillation parameters using machine learning techniques. I implemented two optimization methods: a Univariate minimizer and a Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimisation - Simulated Annealing (HPSO-SA) minimizer. The project focused on minimizing a negative log-likelihood function to extract the relevant parameters. I compared and tested both optimization approaches to ensure accuracy and efficiency, showcasing the power of machine learning in scientific analysis.',
